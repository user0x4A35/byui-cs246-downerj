# 09 Ponder : Status Report

1. What features were completed in your project this week?
This sprint/milestone, we added all of the views (activities) for User Login, User Registration, User Account Details, Income Transactions and Expense Transactions.
We also added all of the Firebase API code which has greatly advanced our ability to see concrete results in real time.


2. What bugs were fixed in your project this week?
This week, we've fixed bugs related to the views, particularly how the icons and buttons appear (namely, basic color schemes).
We also fixed bugs related to duplicating Activities (e.g. the Incomes Activity from the Expenses Activity).


3. Did anyone on your team have an infraction this week?
We did not properly evaluate infractions, but if anything, I amresponsible mainly for not working on as much as I said I would during my own time. No infractions were committed relating to group meetings.


4. If someone did have an infraction, was the penalty paid?
No penalties were paid.


5. How many hours did you spend on your team project this week?
I personally spend about 4.5 hours on my project this week.


6. Are there any issues related to your team or project you want to tell your instructor about?
I have no issues, no. Klevin has been very helpful what with his expertise and diligence. I've been treading at most at 1/3 of his pace getting this project done.
